# volve-drilling

This is the reproducible version of the article __Exploring drilling data from the Volve dataset with WITSML and R__ that was originally published in [my blog](http://blog.OilGainsAnalytics.com) on *January 27, 2019*, and in LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-drilling-data-from-volve-dataset-witsml-r-alfonso-r-reyes/).


In this repository you will find the following assets:

* All the code in a Rmarkdown notebook as running in the [OilGainsAnalytics.com](http://OilGainsAnalytics.com) blog. That includes the last four plots at the end.

* The Volve drilling datasets for three wells used in the Rmarkdown notebook. Located under `./witsml`.

* An R script `witsml-trajectory.R` that has functions that allow quickly to convert a WITSML trajectory dataset to a dataframe.

* Two PDF files with documentation about the objects `trajectory` and `trajectoryStation`. Located under `./docs`.

* Images that were inserted in the publication. Located under `./img`

* There are notes on how to convert XML to dataframes under the folder `./notebooks`
